# CARS
Curvature-Aware Random Search

This repo has three folders for three different experiments.

1. CARS_minimal:
  This includes the minimal example for CARS/CARS-NQ in MATLAB

2. CARS_MoreGarbowHillstrom: 
  This experiment solves More-Garbow-Hillstrom problems with CARS and some other algorithms for comparison, and produces a performance profile.
  
3. CARS_MNIST: 
  This is for the black-box adversarial attack on MNIST dataset.

Each folder has its own Readme file, so have a look at it for more details.
