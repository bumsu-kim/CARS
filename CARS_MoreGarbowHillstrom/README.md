CARS on More-Garbow-Hillstrom Problems

Run MORE_TEST_PERF_PROF.m
Parameters for problem settings can be done in MORE_TEST_PERF_PROF.m
(e.g. choosing functions, setting # of repetitions, target accuracy, etc.)

Hyperparameters regarding each algorithm can be set in Parameter_Settings.m

In moretest_script.m, you can select a category of problems to solve, and algorithms to run.
There are three different types of problems that can be tested:
  (1) More-Garbow-Hillstrom 34 problems
  (2) More-Garbow-Hillstrom 34 problems with Oscillatory noise
  (3) Convex Quartic function with Oscillatory noise
